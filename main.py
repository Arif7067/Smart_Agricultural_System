                This dataset is created manually and also with the help of open source data by identifying pant diseases(rice, sugarcane,tea) and taking picture. After that it was divded into class with respect to the symptoms of different disease for plant.
                This dataset consists of about rgb images of healthy and diseased leaves which is categorized into different classes.The total dataset is divided into 80/20 ratio of training and validation set preserving the directory structure.
                A new directory containing test images is created later for prediction purpose.
